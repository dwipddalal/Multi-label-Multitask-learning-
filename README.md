# Multilabel Multitask Learning with PyTorch for NLP
Description
This project is a PyTorch implementation of multilabel multitask learning for NLP. Multilabel multitask learning is a technique where a single model is trained to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, each with its own set of labels. This approach has been shown to improve performance over single-task learning, especially when the tasks are related.

In this project, we focus on the NLP domain and demonstrate how to train a single model to perform multiple NLP tasks, such as text classification, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. We use PyTorch as the deep learning framework and provide a modular architecture that allows for easy integration of new tasks and models.
